# Metacritic score over time
A small python script to get statistics related to metacritic scores for video games over the years

## Description
I was glancing over the metacritic score for PC games for 2018, and noticed the large amount of negative user reviews. I thought nothing of it, and continued to look at the metacritic scores for earlier years. I noticed a trend that the earlier I went in time, the more positive user reviews I saw. I wondered if there was any merit to this observation. So I made this small Python script to see for myself.
